# Editor Requirements
It seems like a new, promising text editor comes along every few months. While they promote differentiating features, it's easy to lose track of the essential features that I use regularly. Here is a list to capture those features to use as guide to see if they are supported (natively or via plugin):

* Split screen into panels (especially horizontally)
* Single file in multiple panels
* Gutter indicators for CSS/SCSS/JS linting
* Project based lint support
* editorconfig support
* File icons
* Good dark theme
* Multiline cursor
* Auto highlight same selected text
* Project-based file tree
* Exclude files/folders from fuzzy search
* Syntax highlighting:
    * HTML
    * JS
    * CSS/SCSS
    * Markdown
    * YML
* File fuzzy search
* Auto bracket/tag matching and jump-to toggle
* Custom snippets shortcuts
* Move whole line of text up/down (bonus for auto-indenting)
